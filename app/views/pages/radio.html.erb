			<p style="text-align:justify">African Trauma Radio is a program that is written in English which is then translated/acted out in local languages to each different countries. Currently, we are working on our twelfth language, and I have been deeply involved in the last four. As a Production Assistant, I cut costs by 20% and increased our production speed. As an editor, I work on managing audio levels, cutting the entire radio program together, and adding sound effects where needed. On the left is a video interview with George, a director at one of the radio stations, and he shares his thoughts on the importance of Trauma Healing Radio.</p>
