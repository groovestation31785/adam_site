                <p >Let me start by thanking you for visiting my website which is focused on my pursuit for professional development. 
                Since I was a kid, getting a job designing, publishing, or marketing a product that people can enjoy has been my dream. In college I also found a new passion for communication studies, specifically rhetoric. The core elements of creating, pitching, and gaining an audience for a product can be tied into this concept of rhetoric, and that excites me greatly. 
				I'm a self-starter. I have been all my life. Whether it was designing and writing a video game magazine in grade school, creating and managing a Kickstarter while being a full time college undergrad, or directing and marketing a one-act play; I embraced new opportunities and challenges.I carry this mentality into my professional life.  I refuse to believe any task is truly impossible, and I utilize my resources and diverse experience to overcome unyielding obstacles. I thrive on learning, and using outside the box problem solving to avoid further future issues. 
				Currently, I am a video editor and production assistant at Life Focus Communication, a small company where I engage new ways to save time, cut costs, and enhance production every day. My specialties/skills include digital media management, professional communication, brand awareness, and a can-do attitude. </p>
